%description
Net::DBus provides a Perl API for the DBus message system. The DBus Perl
interface is currently operating against the 0.32 development version of
DBus, but should work with later versions too, providing the API changes
have not been too drastic.

Users of this package are either typically, service providers in which case
the the Net::DBus::Service manpage and the Net::DBus::Object manpage
modules are of most relevance, or are client consumers, in which case the
Net::DBus::RemoteService manpage and the Net::DBus::RemoteObject manpage
are of most relevance.
